For loop:
#include <iostream>
//for loop
int main(){

// i = index
//This is a C++ program that uses for loop to print "HAPPY NEW YEAR" five (5) times
    for(int i = 1;  i <= 5; i++){
        std::cout << "HAPPY NEW YEAR!\n";
    }

    return 0; //The program returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
}
